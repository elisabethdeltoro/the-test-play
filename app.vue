      <p>
        Welcome. The Test serves as a data
        collection tool for graduate research through the University of Glasgow.
        If you choose to proceed, your participation in the study would consist
        of watching a 40 minute piece of interactive theatre on your device,
        and voting on several plot points along the way. Your votes will be
        anonymously collected as research data. This data will be analysed
        comparing two different experiences of the same piece of theatre.
      </p>

      <p>
       This experience is best suited to being watched on a computer. Please do <strong>not</strong> refresh or press the "back" button at any point during the show,
         as it will interfere with the collection of data and <em>you may be unable to return to where you left off.</em>

<h3>Sounds/Projection Videos</h3>
    <p>All sound effects and foley were pulled from the BBC Sound Effects library. If you have always wanted to listen to lots
      and lots of forest noise with random monkey hooting in the background... you gotta check out 
      the <a target="blank" href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?q=monkey">BBC Sound Effects Library</a>.
      They also have stuff without monkeys, as you heard in this show.
          <p>Projection videos for this show were sourced through the creative commons on <a target="blank" href="pexels.com" >pexels.com.</a>
           I haven't seen everything on there but unfortunately I have found their monkey in the forest footage a little less extensive than that
           on the BBC Sound Effects Library.</p>

    </p>
<br>

<br>
        <h3>Additional Thanks</h3>
    <p>I would like to thank all the people who talked me through this script on video calls from other 
      time zones, who volunteered their voices for parts that disappeared, offered advice on participatory 
      theatre, and helped with the 800 other mini-tasks that popped up in the large task of Making A Play.
    Thank you to Annabelle, Sophie, Leilani, Celeste, Delia, Rebekah, Ilse, and Laura for all of your 
    contributions and thoughts! </p>

        <p>To the voiceover actors, thank you for your talents, your time, and your willingness to 
          download and learn how to operate audio recording software. You are all great friends for 
          doing this, I appreciate it so much. Hold it over my head forever.</p>

        <p>Huge thanks goes out to Katie, my director, for doing 8 people's worth of work and being so 
          goddamn insightful while doing it. I would recommend you for any project any day. 
          Thanks for going on this weird dark journey with me.</p>

        <p>Alyson you singlehandedly carried this website out of a trench and into an 
          air-conditioned room with internet!!  An angel and a heroine!!!! I cannot thank you enough!!!
          You get more exclamation points than anyone else!!!! </p>

        <p>And final thanks to the girl reading this :) But seriously without audience members 
          this project would have produced no data and would have been ultimately meaningless. 
          Thank you, reader/audience member/research participant, for the time you took answering 
          stressful questions and for giving me your 
          answers. If you'd like to see the final data, or just wanna talk to me about the research 
          in general, feel free to email me! 2645180D@student.gla.ac.uk (I didn't pick it, I would 
          never make you type my whole student id number, blame Adam Smith, etc)
