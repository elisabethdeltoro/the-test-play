# The Test Play
The Test is an original play in which audience members were permitted to choose the protagonist's actions for themselves. I wrote and performed this play, online and in person, then audience choices in both scenarios were datafied for further analysis.
Data collection has come to a close, but you can still watch the show for yourself at https://www.the-test-play.co.uk
