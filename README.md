# the-test-play
This is part of my dissertation project for an MSc in the U. of Glasgow's Digital Society and Social Change.
The goal for this project is to bring my performing arts background into conversation with my sociology training- 
so it warranted an unorthodox research method! I'm collecting audience members' choices in an original interactive theater work, 
and comparing when/if those choices diverge online vs. offline.
Watch the show for yourself at https://www.the-test-play.co.uk

Stay tuned, as the data collection period comes to a close, I'll be updating this space with my analysis!
