# The Test Play
This is part of my dissertation project for an MSc in the U. of Glasgow's Digital Society and Social Change.
The goal for this project is to bring my performing arts background into conversation with my sociology training- 
so it warranted an unorthodox research method! I'm collecting audience members' choices in an original interactive theater work, 
and comparing when/if those choices diverge online vs. offline.
Data collection has come to a close, but you can still watch the show for yourself at https://www.the-test-play.co.uk

Interested in how everyone voted? You can see how I collated the results in the Show Data folder. It turns out, in this study anyways, the online vs. IRL distinction doesn't carry as much weight as one might imagine! You can take a look at my findings at https://www.the-test-play.co.uk/data.html
